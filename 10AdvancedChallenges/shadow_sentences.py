"""
For the purpose of this challenge, shadow sentences are sentences where every 
word is the same length and order but without any of the same letters. 
Write a function that accepts two parameters that may or may not be shadows of each other. 
The function should return True if they are and False if they arenâ€™t.
An example would be "they are round" and "fold two times," which are shadow sentences, 
while "his friends" and "our company" are not because both contain an r.
